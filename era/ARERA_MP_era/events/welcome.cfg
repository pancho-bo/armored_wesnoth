Modifications:
	- Units have high chance to hit (95% melee, 90% ranged).
	- Only one attack and counterattack.
	- Armor concept: after the first attack on unit, damage done to it will be mitigated. If unit is resting then damage will be mitigated during the first attack too.
	- Armor is affected by terrain, 40% defense terrain means 0 bonus armor, 50% is 1 bonus armor and so on.
	- Armor effect on damage will be shown during an attack as numbers of blue or orange colors.
	- In order to handle armor, units stats had been changed."
